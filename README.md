# tarot_capstone_project

My project makes tarot card reading more accessible by simplifying the process, allowing anyone to engage with it regardless of their prior knowledge or experience. By creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface, the platform removes the complexity often associated with traditional tarot readings, making it easy for users to draw cards, interpret their meanings, and gain insights in a straightforward and engaging way.
